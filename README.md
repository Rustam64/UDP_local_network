Step 1
The proposed Python 3-based P2P system using UDP protocol consists of two main tasks:
Task 1: Client-Side Operations  This task involves the client side operations that allow the user to perform various functions such as sending and receiving files, broadcasting files to multiple clients, and displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices.
The client-side operations will be responsible for the following tasks:
1. Establishing a connection with a server. 2. Sending files such as images, CSV, and JSON files to another client. 3. Broadcasting a file to multiple clients. 4. Displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices. 5. Calculating the end-to-end latency for each scenario and having a timeout for sending a file.
Task 2: Server-Side Operations
This task involves the server-side operations that allow the user to set up a P2P network.
The server-side operations will be responsible for the following tasks:
1. Establishing a connection with a client. 2. Receiving files from the client. 3. Broadcasting files to multiple clients. 4. Maintaining a list of connected clients.
In order to demonstrate the proposed P2P system, the following tools will be used:
1. Cisco Packet Tracer: This will be used to create a network topology for the P2P system. 2. Wireshark: This will be used to capture the network traffic and analyze the results.
Well commented code will be used throughout the development of the proposed system in order to make the code more readable and understandable.

Explanation:
The proposed Python 3-based P2P system using TCP protocol consists of two main tasks: client-side operations and server-side operations. The client-side operations involve tasks such as sending and receiving files, broadcasting files to multiple clients, and displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices. The server-side operations involve tasks such as establishing a connection with a client, receiving files from the client, broadcasting files to multiple clients, and maintaining a list of connected clients.
The client-side operations involve the following tasks:
1. Establishing a connection with a server: The client will be responsible for establishing a connection with a server. This can be done using the Python socket module. The socket module provides access to the BSD socket interface. The client will need to specify the host address and port number of the server. Once the connection is established, the client can begin sending and receiving data from the server.
2. Sending files such as images, CSV, and JSON files to another client: The client will be responsible for sending files such as images, CSV, and JSON files to another client. This can be done using the Python socket module. The client will need to specify the host address and port number of the destination client. The client will then serialize the data and send it to the destination client.
3. Broadcasting a file to multiple clients: The client will be responsible for broadcasting a file to multiple clients. This can be done using the Python socket module. The client will need to specify the host address and port number of the destination clients. The client will then serialize the data and send it to the destination clients.
4. Displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices: The client will be responsible for displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices. This can be done using the Python Tkinter module. The Tkinter module provides a GUI (graphical user interface) for applications. The client will need to create a window and widgets such as buttons and text boxes. The user can then select different choices from the menu form.
5. Calculating the end-to-end latency for each scenario and having a timeout for sending a file: The client will be responsible for calculating the end-to-end latency for each scenario and having a timeout for sending a file. This can be done using the Python time module. The time module provides functions for working with time and dates. The client can then calculate the time it takes for a file to be sent and received. The client can also set a timeout for sending a file if it takes too long


3-step

The server-side operations involve the following tasks:
1. Establishing a connection with a client: The server will be responsible for establishing a connection with a client. This can be done using the Python socket module. The socket module provides access to the BSD socket interface. The server will need to specify the host address and port number of the client. Once the connection is established, the server can begin sending and receiving data from the client.
2. Receiving files from the client: The server will be responsible for receiving files from the client. This can be done using the Python socket module. The server will need to specify the host address and port number of the client. The server will then deserialize the data received from the client.
3. Broadcasting files to multiple clients: The server will be responsible for broadcasting files to multiple clients. This can be done using the Python socket module. The server will need to specify the host address and port number of the destination clients. The server will then serialize the data and send it to the destination clients.
4. Maintaining a list of connected clients: The server will be responsible for maintaining a list of connected clients. This can be done using the Python list data structure. The server will need to store the host address and port number of each client in a list. The server can then use this list to keep track of the connected clients.





Step 4:

In order to demonstrate the proposed P2P system, the following tools will be used:
1. Cisco Packet Tracer: This will be used to create a network topology for the P2P system. Packet Tracer is a network simulator developed by Cisco Systems. It allows users to design, configure, and simulate a network topology. This can be used to create a network topology for the proposed P2P system.
2. Wireshark: This will be used to capture the network traffic and analyze the results. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It allows users to capture and analyze network traffic. This can be used to capture the network traffic of the proposed P2P system and analyze the results.
Well commented code will be used throughout the development of the proposed system in order to make the code more readable and understandable. Comments are lines of code that are not executed by the interpreter but are used to explain the code. This makes it easy for someone who is not familiar with the code to understand what the code is doing. This will help to ensure that the proposed system is developed correctly and is easy to maintain.
In conclusion, the proposed Python 3-based P2P system using TCP protocol consists of two main tasks: client-side operations and server-side operations. The client-side operations involve tasks such as sending and receiving files, broadcasting files to multiple clients, and displaying a menu form that allows the user to select choices. The server-side operations involve tasks such as establishing a connection with a client, receiving files from the client, broadcasting files to multiple clients, and maintaining a list of connected clients. The proposed system will be demonstrated using Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark. Well commented code will also be used throughout the development of the proposed system.
